Comparison of three standing occupant models for vertical human-structure interaction
Manuscript Number:STRUCTURES-D-21-01989

This is a well-written paper on an important topic in structural engineering. 
However, it is not suitable for journal publication due to insufficient increment in novelty.
The novel aspects of the paper are very limited and do not sufficiently add to the body of knowledge.
In it's present form, it is better suited to a conference publication.
Finally there are some major and minor technical criticisms that are described to aid the authors further work.

Throughout the paper there is a confusion between the terms "structure" and "system".
It is very important to be clear that the structural dynamic properties do not change.
Instead, the addition of human dynamic systems to the structural system creates a new composite dynamic system.
It is this system then that is incorrectly referred to as the "structure" in many cases in the paper.

There is very little difference between the M-SD and 2M-SD model once the natural frequency of the system is thought of instead of separately considering mass and stiffnesses.
Indeed, more generally, the comparisons in the latter half of the paper make assumptions about the active/inactive mass; instead keeping the natural frequencies of the human sub-systems equal would make more sense.

Finally, the extensive comparisons of the models with the present results and other literature results is somewhat flawed.
Relative errors are provided to two decimal places, contingent on deterministic inputs parameters.
However, this fails to recognize that the problem has extreme stochasticity; mostly the human system parameters, but also the structural parameters.
So any meaningful comparison for such a problem needs to consider uncertainty.


Some minor comments are:
- References should be provided for the grade of steel and glass used in the experimental platform.
- It is "clear span" not "clean span".
- Section 1; the research aim refers to "discreteness" - what is this?
- The genders of the participants should be made known due to the different fat percentages between men and women, which leads to different levels of active and inactive mass.
- Eq (1) assumes simply-supported behaviour, but this should be validated as most real systems have some degree of rotational fixity at supports due to friction.
- What are the "velocity sensors" and how are accelerations found - what filtering etc is used?
